Aniray
======
[Aniray](https://github.com/HypersonicED/aniray) is a library for animating and
orchestrating large arrays of emitters, actuators, displays, and more.

> **NOTE:** This library is under active development and is currently prone to
large breaking changes. Following the first release Aniray will conform to
semantic versioning.

## Principles

- **Large Installation Focused:** Aniray is a one-stop solution for large
  systems individual parts. Object placement and hardware configuration are
  configured separately from the code so that they may change freely as
  projects change during development.
- **Visualization Independent:** Many installations of lights and actuators
  don't include a screen output. Aniray is not built specifically for any other
  graphics toolkit (i.e. Cinder or openFrameworks). These frameworks may be
  used alongside Aniray but are not required.
- **Standards Driven, Hardware Independent:** Exact hardware components vary
  from project to project, and sometimes original parts aren't available when
  repairs are necessary. Rather than picking specific or proprietary products,
  this library aims to use broadly-supported standards that allow for the most
  flexibility.
- **Abstracted and Extensible:** Most C++ classes in Aniray that provide
  support for a particular function or task are extended from broader base
  classes. This promotes user extensibility of Aniray and open source
  contribution to the library.
- **Time-based Processing:** Tasks are performed in reference to time, not
  frames. This allows for a consistent experience across hardware platforms of
  varying processing power. If a machine is not up to the task, then it will be
  immediately obvious instead of slowing down.
- **Open Source for Unrestricted Use:** Aniray promotes the idea that the
  technical tools and resources to create art should be free and open (with
  attribution) while understanding that creative and artistic practice may
  remain proprietary to the artist. Aniray aims to separate the technical
  boilerplate from the creative process and lower the bar to enter the creative
  process. Aniray does not depend on resources that require open sourcing the
  creative code.

## Key Terminology
 - **Node:** A Node is a control point in an installation in physical space.
   This may be a LED pixel, an actuator assembly, some other output device, or
   a combination of these. For example, in a series of winches that move up and
   down each winch is a Node with a vertical axis control. If there are lights
   at the end of the winches, then the combination of the light and winch is
   still one Node (where the node has a vertical position and color outputs).
   If there are lights not specific to each winch, then these would be separate
   Nodes. Nodes may be tied to a physical output or used virtually in
   animations to inform physical Nodes.
 - **Node Array:** A Node Array is group of Nodes. A Node Array can be
   initialized from a list of positions and addresses. A Node Array can also be
   generated by creating a dense 3D grid around another Node Array.
 - **Node Array Output:** A Node Array Output ties a Node Array to a physical
   output device.
 - **Node Array Sampler:** A Node Array Sampler allows for sampling values from
   a dense Node Array to inform a less-dense Node Array. The sampling mapping
   can be found automatically by distance or can be defined statically.
 - **IO Interface:** An IO Interface is an interface to inputs and outputs to
   the application. These can be discrete, counters, integers, etc.

## Features

- Automatic subsampling node grid generation and caching
- Load node physical data from CSV
- Visualization framework independent (can be used with Cinder, oFx, etc.)
- Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) for lighting output allowing for robust many
  universe outputs of E1.31 (sACN), Artnet, KiNET, USB DMX adapters, and more.
- Extensible output classes for other output methods
- Modbus support receiving inputs separate from nodes
- Extensible IO classes for other input and output methods
- Threaded runners for receiving inputs and sending frames at fixed rates
- Boost Geometry types for graphics-independent transformations
- Templated data structs and output transformations for nodes

## Planned Features
 - Node-specific animation queues
 - Thorough Doxygen documentation
 - Thread safety for all methods, not just methods always used in threads

## Requirements

- Only tested on Linux, but may work on other platforms
- C++17
- clang or gcc, untested on other platforms
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) >= 1.74.0 (Boost Software License)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) >= 1.1.0 (OpenSSL License)
- [libola](https://docs.openlighting.org/ola/doc/latest/index.html) >= 0.10.8
  (LGPL) or turn off with `-DANIRAY_WITHOUT_OLA=ON` and bring
  or contribute your own output
- [libmodbus](https://libmodbus.org/) >= 3.1.6 (LGPL) or turn off with
  `-DANIRAY_WITHOUT_MODBUS=ON` and
  or contribute bring your own IO
- Bundled requirements (Git submodules):

## Build and Lint Requirements

- CMake
- pkg-config
- `iwyu` >= 0.15 (include-what-you-use) with `-DANIRAY_WITH_LINT=ON`
- `clang-tidy` >= 13.0.0 with `-DANIRAY_WITH_LINT=ON`

## Using

1. Install required dependencies above
2. Clone with submodules
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/HypersonicED/aniray.git
   ```
3. Either:
   - Add to your `CMakeLists.txt`
   - Build the static library
     ```bash
     cmake -H. -B_builds/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
     ```
   - Build the shared library (NOTE: This is not usually useful due to
     templated types)
     ```bash
     cmake -H. -B_builds/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
     ```
